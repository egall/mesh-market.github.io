-   A Marketplace for Decentralized Resources on the Blockchain
-   A Universal Platform
-   A Path to Economic Fairness

# Introduction<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

Mesh Market is a free application aiming to:

-   introduce the benefits of peer-to-peer goods and services to the public at large
-   enable consumers to find friendlier and cheaper local alternatives to centrally-owned, inefficiently distributed resources
-   accelerate deployment and improve market viability of beneficial technologies by providing them with a direct-to-consumer platform
-   create a fair, open market by providing users with only the most relevant information for making wise economic decisions

Check out the prototype (under construction &#x2013; very early stage):

<https://mesh-market.github.io>

With Mesh Market, you can:
-   get cheaper, better internet service &#x2013;
    or start a do-it-yourself ISP to offer it
-   reduce the cost of your electricity bills while supporting renewable energy &#x2013;
    or start a profitable energy business from your own home enabling people to do so
-   find quality organic produce in your own neighborhood &#x2013; or start supplying it for profit
-   buy/sell/lease/rent real-estate without losing a huge cut to a middleman
-   find a cheap ride &#x2013; or drive for a living&#x2026; without losing a huge cut to a middleman (yes, that's the underlying theme here)
-   get access to affordable, humane insurance
-   find the highest quality, most relevant news for your economic decisions &#x2013;
    or get paid to distribute such news
-   do countless other things, many yet to be conceived (see our various use cases)

# Background<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

The Mesh Market app was originally conceived by developers at OptiPulse who were envisioning a direct-to-consumer platform for getting OptiPulse's internet technology
to the market.  Eventually it was realized that the same infrastructure for doing this could also be used to decentralize resources besides bandwidth, and the Mesh Market Foundation was created to develop the app to its full potential.

## Platform Business<a id="sec-2-1" name="sec-2-1"></a>

### Overview<a id="sec-2-1-1" name="sec-2-1-1"></a>

A platform business erases the distinction between producers and consumers of goods and services by providing consumers with some form of infrastructure for creating value on their own.  This infrastructure is
often an unassuming means of facilitating customer match-making, such as Uber's mobile app.  Such businesses tend to uncover value already existent, but previously unrecognized - mainly because it resides in the hands of consumers.
Platform business have shown us that this sort of value actually constitutes the lion's share of the market - when it is effectively utilized.
As Tech Crunch put it

    "Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s most popular media owner,
     creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world’s largest
    accommodation provider, owns no real estate. Something interesting is happening."

As internet access becomes more ubiquitous, this trend will intensify.  But as we've seen lately with Uber and AirBnB's legal battles, this isn't a welcome change for all.
Despite the innocuous tenets of the "sharing economy" with which some platforms hope to be identified, opposition to their practices isn't without merit; if you look under the hood of the biggest platforms, it's business as usual.
The 'Invisible Hand' is just as unlikely to guide a giant platform as it is a giant pipeline to put people over profits.  Examples aren't hard to find in current news headlines; in Britain, regulators are taking issue with
the convenience with which Uber can hire full-time workers without taking on the responsibilities of a full-time employer. .  Furthermore, contractors have complained about the substantial cut it takes from drivers, typically 20%, which
indeed seems hefty considering the share of the labor involved by the contractors.  As mentioned, platform businesses facing such criticism seek to identify themselves with the bigger picture &#x2013; they are purveyors of this "sharing economy" average-joes are so keen on.
AirBnb, for instance, is promoting a global consumer movementas a shield to their foreseeable legal woes.  But before consumers rise to the defense of the sharing economy à la Uber, might it not be better to ask for a better platform?  If so many people are willing to defend the admittedly imperfect platforms they've come to rely on, why can't some of these people
offer an alternative?  We believe the demand for this platform is already high.  Mesh Market's mission is to become this platform.

### Platformization as a Service<a id="sec-2-1-2" name="sec-2-1-2"></a>

The way Mesh Market can accomplish this is by being a universal platform.  Businesses looking for way to keep up with the shifting nature of C2B relations have a way to
migrate their products and services onto the Blockchain, maintaining customization and integrity of their products, but reaching customers through a new channel.

![img](./media/incentive-creation-diagram.png)

To see how this works, let's start with a beneficial idea lacking in incentive&#x2026;

## Mesh Networking<a id="sec-2-2" name="sec-2-2"></a>

Before we discuss how Mesh Market makes it so easy to decentralize resources, we need to explain why adopting mesh networks would be a good idea.

According to Wikipedia, "A mesh network is a network topology in which each node relays data for the network. All mesh nodes cooperate in the distribution of data in the network."

In other words, mesh networks get rid of centralized computing resources in favor of distributed networks.

Mesh Market takes this concept to the next level and seeks to decentralize all resources - insofar as that's possible.

The original goal of this app was to develop OptiPulse unique potential for revolutionizing the mesh/ad-hoc networking market with its Light Grid technology.  Bandwidth, via mesh-networking, is the first resource
that Mesh Market aims to decentralize - though by no means the last.While the mesh-networking userbase is presently miniscule compared to that of conventional, centrally serviced connections (usually provided by one of only a few differnet ISP's), meshes offer many advantages
over heterogeneous networks, making them the ideal network topology for future networks needing to prioritize scalability.  There are many articles/papers weighing these advantages, so the discussion here will be brief:

### Advantages<a id="sec-2-2-1" name="sec-2-2-1"></a>

1.  Scalability:

    Adding more devices to the network tends to improve mesh connections, in contrast to star topologies.  More devices connected to a mesh network locally means more possible paths through which internet traffic can be routed.

2.  Robustnesss:

    Power outages, network attacks, and threats to individual nodes circulate and infect the entire network in the star topology most people are connected by.
    In contrast to this, there is no central point of failure in a mesh network, so the loss of any one node won't affect the connectivity of the entire network.
    Those who were able to get WIFI in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy know this isn't mere speculation.  <http://techpresident.com/news/23127/red-hook-mesh-network-connects-sandy-survivors-still-without-power>

3.  Democritization:

    Dictators have been known to cut off internet service during popular uprisings.  It is virtually impossible to "shut down" a mesh-based internet. Without the imperitave for centrally-connected hubs, disrupting connections becomes very hard to achieve.

    That authorities might cut off the internet is significantly less likely in countries without the egregious network collusion with government we
    see in many developing countries.  Be that as it may, such countries may turn out to be some of the best stages on which to demonstrate the power of decentralized markets for effecting positive social change.

    One criticism of the idea that mesh networks could make the internet impervious to control by dictators is that WIFI signals can be traced and individuals can be targeted even
    if the network is a mesh .  This criticism would not apply to point-to-point links, which we believe many next-generation internet technologies will
    be.

### Difficulties<a id="sec-2-2-2" name="sec-2-2-2"></a>

There are also several difficulties associated with meshes that shouldn't be overlooked.  Some of these may be mitigated by the design of an application fulfilling many
functions normally assigned to the network administrator, while others may be reducable to inadequacies of present physical layer technologies.

1.  Power Consumption

    From link-labs: "Because each node in a mesh has to act as an endpoint and a router, it has to draw more power to operate. Thus, if you have battery-powered, low-power nodes, a mesh may be difficult to deploy without a lot of network planning."

2.  Latency

3.  Requisite Technical Competence

    Currently, most mesh networking protocols are available solely as command line tools for Unix-like operating systems.  As it stands, this significantly reduces the class of users
    capable of connecting to a mesh network.

4.  Opposition from Established Middlemen

    Analagous to the situation faced by Tesla due to their direct-to-consumer market strategy, those who normally take a large share of the profits by acting as middle-men
    between the consumer and the product/service stand to lose much in a decentralized consumer-to-consumer market.  This means that, just as Tesla sales have been
    blocked in certain states due to the threat it poses to the established car-dealership model,
    a mesh-networking platform with a chance of succeeding may raise the defenses of ISP's. This possibility should be discussed in more detail.  It seems to us that
    the case against mesh-networks would be much more difficult to make, and legal challenges are unlikely to pose a sustained threat.

## Next-Generation Wireless<a id="sec-2-3" name="sec-2-3"></a>

While big names like Google make plans for massive yet noninclusive fiber buildouts, a new generation of wireless internet technologies is emerging as a serious challenger
to the conventional wisdom that more bandwidth necessitates more fiber. Feats of innovation have and will continue to power an internet revolution that can deliver high-speed connections
to everyone &#x2013; not just those privileged to be living in the richest cities where costly backhaul buildout is conceivable.  Wireless seems the obvious means toward this end, as it the avoids
prohibitively costly construction costs of digging up vast stretches of earth, repairing broken cables, etc.  Not to mention the added convenience of avoiding zoning laws in many instances.
Let's examine some of the exciting new developments in wireless hardware:

### OptiPulse<a id="sec-2-3-1" name="sec-2-3-1"></a>

OptiPulse is a tech startup with a revolutionary internet technology called the Light Grid.  It is a physical-layer technology based on a novel invention in electro-optics, which just so happens to
overcome many of the difficulties associated with mesh networks like power consumption and latency.  Like other elite photonic transmitters, it is capable of 5G bit-rates.  Unlike fiber-optics, however,
it is wireless and therefore relatively cheap and easy to deploy.  Being a new company in the prototype stage of development, Optipulse (or other companies with already-proven concepts) could
use Mesh Market to offer a pre-sale of its products and fund product development without resorting to outside investment.  A pre-sale strategy  could enable companies to reach production stage
without diluting ownership and sacrificing vision.

![img](./media/prototype-image.jpg)
OptiPulse's Prototype

1.  Specs

    1.  Bandwidth

        OptiPulse has demonstrated 10Gb/s + bit rates.  This is thousands of time faster than what the FCC allows to be advertised as high-speed internet, or broadband.

    2.  Distance

        Early tests and estimates have projected that the Light Grid's transmission range may be over 10 km.

    3.  Deployability

        Unlike fiber-optics, there is no digging up of long stretches of earth to connect two end-points.  As you can imagine, this also avoids legal difficulties like zoning laws.  And digging takes time.

    4.  Unlicensed Spectrum

        The Light Grid uses a part of the RF spectrum that isn't licensed.  Not only is signal interference negligible compared to typical broadcast connections like WiFi, but contending with competitors
        over spectrum licensing is also a non-issue.

    5.  Ecological Friendliness

        Taking load off the typical spectrum bands may also has huge benefits for living organisms, which many believe are harmed by the proliferation of microwaves in the atmosphere.

    6.  Low Size, Weight

    7.  Low Power-Consumption

    8.  Low Cost

        Perhaps most importantly, an infrastructure built on Light Grid technology would be a fraction of the cost of using (comparably fast) fiber.  The digging/installation costs alone
        of fiber are enough to account for this considerable difference in cost.

### Others<a id="sec-2-3-2" name="sec-2-3-2"></a>

Other, more mature companies are also pushing the boundaries of wireless including Ubiquiti, Starry, Mimosa, and more.  As of late 2016, their products are on the market
and can be readily used for building mesh networks.

## Blockchain<a id="sec-2-4" name="sec-2-4"></a>

Blockchain technology is based on the idea of a distributed ledger.  It is meant to provide trust and security through radical transparency rather than limited access.
Blockchain plays a crucial role in Mesh Market's plan to overcome the inertia keeping good ideas from gaining traction.

### Smart Contracts<a id="sec-2-4-1" name="sec-2-4-1"></a>

The concept of a smart contract was first formulated in the 90's, but required blockchain technology to achieve practical implementability.  Basically a smart contract is
a contract that can execute itself.  This means that terms and conditions are defined programatically, such that a computer can know how they should be interpreted.
Of course, this limits the contents of the contract to what is computationally tractable.  For example, a smart contract may define certain operations being executed when an
account on the blockchain receives a certain amount of funds.

It may not seem obvious from the simplistic discussion of smart contracts above, but the ability for computers to listen to data and execute transactions on a blockchain enables the implementing of
an innumerable array of business solutions heretofore unworkable or impractical - particularly those based on the idea of turning a traditionally top-down service into a consumer-to-consumer platform.
Decentralized platforms based on blockchain/smart contracts are already being developed across a range of industries (even entire governemnts!), though it is still too early
for average consumers to have noticeably benefited.  The platform business phenomenon and the sharing economy at large, on the other hand, have had a huge impact on what customers expect from the services they use,
and demonstrated the substantial demand for useful peer-to-peer services.

### Ethereum<a id="sec-2-4-2" name="sec-2-4-2"></a>

# The Mesh Market Platform<a id="sec-3" name="sec-3"></a>

Where does Blockchain fit in?  There is no shortage of good ideas and technologies that would have a positive impact on the world, if they were only adopted.  Inertia prevents change, even when it is necessary (see Tragedy of the Commons).
We've made the case for certain technologies above; others are making it for renewable energy, a service-based economy, reducing meat consumption, a basic income, and so on.  The ultimate goal of Mesh Market is to create a way to incentivize collective behavior that is manifestly beneficial to everyone.  The purpose of the Mesh Market Protocol is to define what this behavior is.  Finally, the Mesh Market Foundation channels funds into
businesses that seek to implement these solutions, and to incentivize businesses (and people) to use the platform.  Mesh Market the decentralized application (DApp) should be thought of as one part of this eco-system.

![img](./media/mesh-market-ecosystem.png)

It would be unwise for any business developing in the post-smart contract world to implement an overtly top-down approach to customer relations.  We take very seriously
the idea that whatever can be decentralized will be decentralized as the world awakens to the utility of the Blockchain.  Of course, this includes any aspects of the Mesh Market platform that
are inadvertently top-down or fail to prioritize customers' priorities.  This is why we open the design of the Mesh Market platform to feedback and revision via the Protocol.
The Mesh Market aspires to be the platform to end platforms; to achieve this, there must be built-in mechanisms for self-correction.

### Case Study: OptiPulse &#x2013; Making Mesh Networks Mass-Market Viable<a id="sec-3-0-1" name="sec-3-0-1"></a>

Now it should be clear how this platform might actually help good ideas gain momentum.  As we've made the case for above, OptiPulse's Light Grid enabling mesh networks is one potential
application of this formula.

![img](./media/mesh-network-incentivization.png)

The logic works like this:
Since the benefits of mesh networks are not immediately apparent to anyone not versed in computer networking, getting people to switch may prove a difficult task unless some
incentive is provided.

An enabling technology like OptiPulse's can help this good idea overcome the initial hurdles on the road to viability.  But to get complacent users of centralized networks to switch services,
there must be some other incentive provided.

Of course, OptiPulse may have a chance of doing this on the strengths of its incredible hardware alone - if it were to follow a strategy of exclusively promoting its mesh network
capabilities.  However, this would be unnecessarily prescriptive and possibly counterproductive; a better way to show users the advantages of mesh networks would be to give them
a reason to choose it for themselves so that they'd come to understand the benefits through firsthand experience.

With the amount of excess bandwidth the Light Grid may be giving customers, they may be able to get away with sharing (or selling) what they don't use to those around them.
(It might not occur to someone with a 12 Mb/s connection to try this).  In effect, this would make buyers of OptiPulse's internet service their own mini ISP's,
analagous to operators of once-widespread internet cafes.  With some added income from selling bandwidth, OptiPulse's users may be able to break even or even make a profit while
receiving some of the best internet service on the market.

### Building the Platform to End Platforms<a id="sec-3-0-2" name="sec-3-0-2"></a>

This implies that OptiPulse, as an ISP, might sell internet that comes with a commercial license (or form thereof) to end-users.  While this would give users the ability to resell
service and potentially cut into some of OptiPulse's target market, there would be some overwhelmingly positive side-effects:

-   Each customer ultimately connected through an OptiPulse uplink is one fewer customer of an OptiPulse competitor.
-   It would be hard to overestimate customer satisfaction with such a deal.  This would grow the network of app users possibly exponentially, and if every transaction is charged a certain amount to go into OptiPulse's "tip jar", this could grow astronomically.
-   If OptiPulse wished to prevent any portion of profit whatsoever from being appropriated by end-users, it would be very simple to stipulate in a smart contract that customers can only sell to those out of range of OptiPulse service.  Other schemes have been proposed, such as offering customers the opportunity to become an OptiPulse franchise.

These benefits seem especially appealing considering that Mesh Market can facilitate other types of exchange besides internet service.  Given the rise of companies like
Uber, AirBnB, Craigslist and others &#x2013; the services of each of which Mesh Market can replicate &#x2013; a general strategy of growing a base network of users and promoting new use-cases
could prove very lucrative.

In the language of Mesh Market, offers translate into smart contracts, which in turn serve as licenses that may be offered by companies acting as users of the platform.  The products/services
of these companies are the driving force behind Mesh Market's various use-cases.  The Mesh Market platform gives these companies free reign over their own contracts, so they are free to test the waters
between the platform and pipelines philosophies.  Minimizing the demand Mesh-Market places on users &#x2013; be they large companies or first-time DIY'ers &#x2013; ensures that the platform
remains agnostic towards content and inviting to any type of endeavor.

# Application<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a>

## Design<a id="sec-4-1" name="sec-4-1"></a>

One design decision built into Mesh Market is to treat users, whether they be businesses or end-consumers in the conventional sense, as basically having the same requirements for using the Mesh Market platform.  This creates an amorphous market which, while inscrutable to classical economists, will tend to multiply
choices and improve services, thereby fulfilling the basic functions of healthy economy.  As we've shown above, An ISP may use the Mesh Market platform to sell internet service without restrictions on how it does so, treating customers as (perhaps equally)
non-restricted entitites that may act as "mini ISP's" in their own right.  Therefore, the most effective design is the one most capable of meeting the business requirements of the "producers", while making little or no distinction between them
and consumers.  The core features of the app, described below, are an attempt to create such an environment.

Mesh networks are inherently friendly to businesses embracing the platform model.  With a decentralized and free communications medium, preferable local alternatives to inefficient,
sub-par goods and services can be discovered.  This is how "free markets" are supposed to work; they only free and efficient insofar as information flow is.

Incidentally, this is why there is no paid advertising on the Mesh Market platform.  It is an intentional design decision that the only information users see when looking for offers is
what they decide is relevant to making a good choice.

## Core Features<a id="sec-4-2" name="sec-4-2"></a>

### GUI<a id="sec-4-2-1" name="sec-4-2-1"></a>

![img](./media/mesh-market-gui.png)

1.  Make an Offer

2.  Find an Offer

    1.  TODO add find form

3.  Wallet

    1.  Create Wallet

        To create a new wallet, you just need to come up with a good password (your private key.)  Be careful!  If you lose/forget this, it can never be retrieved.

    2.  Open Wallet

        In order to add offers to Mesh Market, you will need your address (the public key you were given when you created your wallet) and your password.

4.  Protocol

    In-app documentation is provided in this section, which explains features of the app to users as well as informing them
    of what the Mesh Market protocol has to say about the contents they find.

5.  Information

    1.  News

        No economic system works with uninformed consumers; the same is true of Mesh Market's highly idealized free market.  The news section is meant to provide users with information relevant to any economic decisions they will be making. Naturally, this criterion leaves room for a broad range of topics.  Since it would be a massive overreach on the part of Mesh Market
        to attempt to provide the contents of the news itself, it leaves this to the users.  News data is stored on local protocol objects, because news is supposed to inspire action - and action starts locally.

    2.  Results

        Results of searches and recommendations also appear in the information section when a form has been submitted.

6.  Map

### Protocol: Defining Future Resource Consumption<a id="sec-4-2-2" name="sec-4-2-2"></a>

The Mesh Market Protocol provides dynamically updated in-app information regarding:
-   the contents of news and offers available in the app
-   the features of the app itself

It is accessed through the protocol object, which is globally stored on the Blockchain.

The Mesh Market Foundation will release an initial protocol specification for the protocol object, and further updates to this object may be determined democratically by users.

A Mesh Market Protocol object is a JSON object that contains several entries, the most basic of which are:

-   TAG: This label describes a common feature of a class of technologies, products, or services.  E.g. "optical", "wireless", "decentralized", etc.
-   RECOMMENDATION: This is is string containing one or more tags that specify the most beneficial implementations of the technology from among the children tags.
-   JUSTIFICATION: This is a humanly readable explanation of an author's reasons for recommending certain implementations of technologies, products, or services over others.
-   CHILDREN: These include all possible implementations of a tag, whether officially recommended or not.

Recommendations, justifications, and so forth are not stored directly on this global object for reasons explained in the transaction sequence diagram section.  Rather,
the illusion of mutability is effected through addresses pointing to updateable values, such as urls.

    // data returned by the smart contract pointing to the global protocol object
    {
     "app" : address,
     "tags" : address
    }

When these addresses are resolved, this evaluates to something resembling the following:

    {"app" : {},
     "tags" :
       {"tag1" :
         {"upvotes" : "",
          "downvotes" : "",
          "recommendation" : "",
          "justification" : "",
          "children" : ["child1", "child2", ...],
         }
       }
    }

The Mesh Market Protocol is meant to specify which technologies are conducive to the overall goals of the Mesh Market Foundation.  Users of Mesh Market may apply for grants
from the foundation if they commit to offering goods or services recommended by the protocol.  This is subject to compliance with the protocol.  Supplying grant money is the largest expenditure
of the Mesh Market Foundation, and one of our most important means of effecting positive change.

Offers may conform to protocol or not based on their tags.  The more in-line with protocol a business' offers, the more likely they are to receive grant money.
Based on the following protocol entry &#x2013; if this were a real entry included in the Protocol Object &#x2013; offers that include the tags "optical" and "wireless" would be more
likely to receive funding than WiFi because of more bandwidth and less RF pollution.

    {"wireless":
      {"upvotes": 15,
       "downvotes": 5,
       "recommendation": "optical",
       "justification" : "more bandwidth, less RF pollution",
       "children": ["optical", "WiFi", "WiGig"]
      }
    }

Each user-submitted protocol entry undergoes vetting before it is added to the Protocol Object.
The vetting process may be as simple as weighing likes against dislikes, but this is itself subject to protocol, and may be revised according to future situations.

1.  Geo-storage for Local Data

    The necessary data for providing local user information, offers, and news are stored in what we call Geo-storage objects, which are tied to geographic regions and are not part of the global protocol object.

        {
         "users" : [address1, address2, ...],
         "offers" : [address1, address2, ...],
         "news" : [address1, address2, ...]
        }

    Again, this makes more sense when it is resolved:

        {"users" :
          [{"nickname" : "",
            "location" : "",
            "reputation" : "",
            "forms" : address,  // reference to a smart contract containing data for customizeable forms
           ...
          }],
         "offers" :
          [{
           "name" : "",
           "description" : "",
           "makerAddress" : "",
           "takerAddresses : [], // typically there will be one taker, but crowdfunding scenarios may call for many
           ...
          }],
          "news" :
          [{
            "headline" : "",
            "link" : "",
            "address" : "",  // <--- identifies user who posted news
            "misleading" : ""
          }]
        }

    Finally, if a user has used the API to customize their interface for making offers, the above will resolve further:

        {"users" :
          [{"nickname" : "",
            "location" : "",
            "reputation" : "",
            "forms" :
             [{input-id-1: "",
               input-name-1: "",
               input-type-1: "",
               input-value-1: "",
               ...
             }]
           ...
          }]
          ...
        }

### API<a id="sec-4-2-3" name="sec-4-2-3"></a>

The standard forms a user fills out while making an offer will be sufficient for most transactions happening on Mesh Market.  However, some users will have more complex needs,
and they can customize:
-   1) the types of offers they are able to make
-   2) the way users can search their offers

by updating their own entry in the protocol object via the API.

-   1) Make Offer

Before users have the ability to find internet service near them, other users need to be able to advertise that they have available connections. The interaction shown in the above diagram revolves around these two core functions; methods peripheral to these are meant to provide a system of trust to ensure that all parties are satisfied with the transaction.

Making an offer is as simple as filling out a form, which may look something like this:

The submitted data is then made public on the blockchain. Unlike conventional apps, a DApp does not require a “back-end” that can be pinned geographically to one server or another. Instead, all relevant data is saved to the blockchain and bound to public keys. These keys may represent a simple account balance, as in the case of Bitcoin, or a complete smart contract. Data can include important details about offers like names, descriptions, time-restrictions, etc.

-   2) Find Offer

This step involves another class of user, the offer taker, submitting a form to query data on the blockchain. This is somewhat tricky compared to fetching data from a server where one knows which tables to read data from. Data stored in the Ethereum blockchain is included in a smart contract, which is invoked using a public key. But how can a user find a suitable offer among the multitude of contracts living on the blockchain? Obviously it won’t work to query each available offer for satisfactory properties like bandwidth, price, etc – this would be very inefficient, because many of these might be in different cities or countries. The best solution may be to create a smart contract bound to a geographical area that will limit queries to only local options, or options within a certain range defined by the user.

This introduces some complications. Blockchain data is immutable, but offers available to users will be constantly changing. The most clever way around this is to have the smart contract bound to a geographical area simply point to the latest version of the area’s blockchain, so that queries will be made on up-to-date data. This creates the illusion that the data users are querying is dynamic, though it is actually immutable.

The latest version of Ethereum has native support for this capability. Here’s an example smart contract meant to relay queries to another that is updateable (borrowed from a Stackoverflow answer :

    contract Relay {
        address public currentVersion;
        address public owner;

        function Relay(address initAddr){
            currentVersion = initAddr;
            owner = msg.sender;
        }

        function update(address newAddress){
            if(msg.sender != owner) throw;
            currentVersion = newAddress;
        }

        function(){
            if(!currentVersion.delegatecall(msg.data)) throw;
        }

-   3) Show Results

Displaying the results to the user is completely straightforward; data retrieved from the blockchain can subsequently be passed to the front-end and may be represented on a map and/or table that the user can interact with.

-   4) Take Offer

The most important way a user can interact with the offers they find is to take (accept) one of them. This involves transfering funds to the smart contract the offer represents, which then tells the offer maker’s device to proceed with releasing the consideration.

-   5) Trigger Consideration

With this step, the blockchain informs the offer maker’s device that the offer has been accepted and it should now fulfill its part of the contract.

-   6) Trigger Side Effects

Now that the maker’s device has received the go-ahead to give consideration, computation may be performed to decide how to go about doing this. This could hypothetically be as simple as converting one currency into another, or may be an involved shell script for allocating bandwidth based on the requirements of the contract.

-   7) Send Resources

Once the requisite computation has been performed to send a resource, it may be sent. This is the only step that may effect extra-internet physical layer activity – be it a laser sending messages or a solar panel plus cabel sending power.

-   8) Send Confirmation

The offer taker’s device is then triggered to inform the blockchain that consideration was met, and that funds should be released.

-   9) Transfer Funds

Finally, the funds being held by the contract starting at step 4 are released, and the transaction is complete.

### Possible Directions<a id="sec-4-2-6" name="sec-4-2-6"></a>

1.  Transactions

    1.  Meshmarks: A Credit System for Enabling Seemless Interaction with the Blockchain

        Offers on the Mesh Market can be paid for in currencies of the offer maker's choosing, as well as in the Mesh Market's own virtual currency, Meshmarks.

        Meshmarks enables easy conversion between payment methods.  Users can load credit to their account using PayPal, credit, debit, or a crypto-currency of their choice.

        Users are not required to buy Meshmarks to make transactions with one-another, but it does help users using unequal payment methods (e.g. Bitcoin and PayPal) reach one-another.

    2.  A Possible Cryptocurrency (MMR)

        One possibility that should be discussed is the minting of a new crypto-currency to serve as store credit.  As such, it would be bound to the growth of decentralized resources.

# The Mesh Market Foundation<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a>

Several functions of the Mesh Market Platform described above have been alluding to a certain "Foundation".  Though this could be a group of well meaning persons, we feel that the
responsibilities are too consequential to entrust to a small group of human decision makers, so the Mesh Market Foundation will be a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that
makes intelligent decisions by a combination of AI and democratic polling of users.

Until the structure of this DAO is satisfactorily balanced and ready to take on future problems, a team of humans will lead the transition effort towards autonomy.

The Mesh Market Foundation is a non-profit organization.  Funds are and always will be used for improving the lives of humans everywhere.
